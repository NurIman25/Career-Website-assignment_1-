            <h2>Step by Step Guide to Becoming a Entrepeneur</h2> <ol> <li>
                    <strong>Build Skills Set and Knowledge Base:</strong>
                    Some serial entrepreneurs have a reputation of being jacks-of-all-trades as they jump around from industry to industry,find more success by focusing on an area of interest and specialization. Pursue a degree or program that teaches entrepreneurial skills and knowledge specific to the industry that i want to get into. </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Build My Network:</strong>
                    Every successful entrepreneur has benefited from their own network of mentors, partners, employees and investors. Once i found a mentor or advisor who can assist me, it’s important to reach out and find other systems of support like Research and vet professionals like financial advisors and lawyers that i feel comfortable trusting and relying on.  </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>State My Idea, Claim My Niche:</strong>
                    Start exploring solutions for every-day problems or frustrations experienced by friends and family and my target markets. As Entrepreneur magazine explains, the most innovative startups are often simple solutions to common problems. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Find and Understand a Market:</strong>
                    The best product in the world isn’t going to succeed if there isn’t a market interested in buying it. Starting broad may seem like a good idea, after all that’s the highest possible number of buyers, but trying to sell to everyone means that it is not really selling to no one. To get a better idea of what your market is going to be, i’ll need to develop an understanding of what people are looking for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Secure Finding:</strong>
                    Attempt to start with securing initial funding or loans from friends and family. Trust levels are high and i might even be able to receive the funds without having to pay interest or offer too much of a share in your company. Of course, this entirely depends on the level of wealth and assets of the people i know.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Build My Business:</strong>
                    Keep working on promoting and marketing my business! After the initial buzz dies off i’ll still need to find ways to reach out to new, prospective customers and announce the latest updates and developments of my product. Review the metrics of my campaigns and social media channels to determine what’s working, and what’s not, and what i should be doing to effectively advertise. </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuously learn and adapt:</strong>
                    The enterpreneurship landscape evolves rapidly. Stay updated with new technologies, tools, and best practices through online courses, blogs, and communities.
                </li>
            </ol>
